This repository is an **academic reference mirror** of the Spectrum system.

## Purpose
To demonstrate **deterministic, exact, replayable measurement logic** suitable for:
- reproducibility research
- auditability studies
- regulatory measurement theory

## Properties
- No floating point arithmetic
- No randomness
- No hidden state
- Bit-identical replay

This repository is **non-commercial** and **non-operational** by design.
